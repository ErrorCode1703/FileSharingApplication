# FileSharingApplication
The web application protects, tracks and controls files shared on Google Drive 

The application is build by Django so I recommend you using Pycharm as an IDE. If you want to run it, you should change directory to FileSharingApplication/Project/ and run a command in a terminal:</br>
<i>&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;python manage.py runserver</i></br></br>
Before running it, please install all required packages. You can check it by running a command:</br>
<i>&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;python manage.py migrate</i></br>
If it lacks any packages, it will show you what package is.
